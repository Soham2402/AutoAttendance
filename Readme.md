How to use:
1) Take screenshots of the attendees (make sure you only take the ss of the attendees section not the whole screen)
2) Upload it in the folder
3) Add the name of the students in the class the studname list

Issues to fix:
Adding functions to mark the attendance of 2 people with same names

Future Iprovements:
Better image post-processing
Using regex for better data cleaning 

Future ideas:
Adding a gui
Automating the whole screenshot process using PyAutogui
